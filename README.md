# Unsupervised-Learning-using-sci-kit-learn
A general implementation and discussion of different unsupervised learning algorithms implemented in python using sci-kit learn library

Unsupervised learning is implemented on wholesale customer data from UCI Machine Learning Library which can accessed using this [link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/292/wholesale+customers)

In this report modest atempt at customer segmentation is made using K-Means clustering and DBSCAN algorithms, the report and 
python code can be accessed from the corressponding folders.
